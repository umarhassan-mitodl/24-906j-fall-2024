This will consist of a 5–7-page study/report that you can develop over the course of the semester. The project will be divided up such that you will first submit a proposal; we will then discuss the proposal together. After this, you will then begin to write your final paper. We are available for comments and feedback on this phase of the paper writing. However, you must take the initiative to set up a time to meet with me or the course writing instructor to discuss any aspect of the paper you are working on. This feedback will be limited. It is not meant to provide a review of a full draft of a paper but rather to give you feedback about a particular focus you are assuming or direction you are taking or to help you if you “get stuck” at a particular juncture.
