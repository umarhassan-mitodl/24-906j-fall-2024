Michael Siegal, Luca Surian, Ayumi Matsuo, Alessandra Geraci, Laura Iozzi, Yuko Okumura, and Shoji Itakura (2010). [“Bilingualism Accentuates Children’s Conversational Understanding.”](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2815776/) *PLoS ONE*, 5(2): 1–7. 

Sigal et al. make interesting claims concerning the effects of bilingualism with respect to sensitivity to conversational maxims. In about 500 to 750 words, consider the claims made by the authors and evaluate whether or not the empirical evidence they provide supports their claims. 

In evaluating this research, you will need to consider all aspects of the experimental design \[age, level of proficiency, languages, task, stimuli, significance of their results. etc.\] in order to determine if the conclusions are supported. What are possible flaws in the design? What would the authors’ predictions be for other linguistic populations? What are possible alternative explanations? How would you re-design the study if warranted? What else needs to be       
considered? If the results can be replicated with other language populations, what would this suggest about the effects of bilingualism? 

You do not have to answer all of these questions. Consider them all, but choose the ones you think will most support the development of your argument.
